# ML-tutorials
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with example uses of various ML tools:
## Dimensionality reduction
* [**SVD**](/notebooks/dim_reduction/SVD.ipynb) - shows how to use SVD (Singular value decomposition) to extract trends from data.
## Linear regression
* [**lin_reggression_dif_methods**](/notebooks/lin_reg/lin_reggression_dif_methods.ipynb) - compares different methods of estimating regression parameters and their uncertainty for a simple linear regression - least squares, bootstrapping, statistical hypothesis testing and Bayesian inference.
